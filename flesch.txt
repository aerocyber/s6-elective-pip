Quantum Computing: The Privacy Killer

The entire Internet rely on cryptography which is responsible for maintaining privacy of users.
Cryptgraphy, though not visible at first glance, hides in plai sight. The "secure" padlock symbol on
your browsers' address bar is an obvious yet missed form of cryptography.

Advancements in quantum computing has made it possible to break several of the cryptographic algorithms.
What this means forthe world is that the information can get altered midway and you'd not know about it.
E2EE fails. And so does digital privacy.
